Installation is almost complete.
The installer is going to try to install some shortcuts.

Shortcut installation will probably produce unusable shortcuts
on MacOsX and linux, but it's nothing serious :

MacOS users : you will find jMESYS where you installed it,
		(usually in "Applications"), ready to be used as a 
		normal mac application.
		
Linux users : double click on libs/jMESYS.jar
